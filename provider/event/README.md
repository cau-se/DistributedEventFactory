# Event Generator

An event is generated in DEF when a transition on the Markov chain has been taken.
Hence, it has the following properties:

- [Activity]()
- [Next Data Source]()
- [Duration]()

Each data source can define multiple possibly generated events. 
Which of these events is selected is examined by the [event selection function](../eventselection/README.md)
